Hey there, thanks for checking out my blog.

My name is Amol Gawai and I am a technology aficionado. Apart from being a software engineering professional, I like traveling, photography, gadgets, food.

I am fascinated by the modern life where technology is everywhere, without we noticing it. Many of us are hard at work to make this possible. My blog is the result of this modern life where I will write about being a “Tech Traveler” through this enchanting modern world.

I envite you to be my fellow voyeger and share experiences, thoughts and ideas.
